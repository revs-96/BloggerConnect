Flask is a micro web framework that provides the tools, libraries and technologies to build a web application. This framework is more Pythonic than Django because Flask web application code is more explicit.

In this blog, we'll explore the fundamentals of Flask development, including routing, templates, and database integration. We'll also cover best practices for building scalable web applications.

Key topics include:
- Setting up a Flask development environment
- Creating routes and handling HTTP requests
- Working with templates using Jinja2
- Database integration with SQLAlchemy
- User authentication and session management
- Deployment considerations

Whether you're a beginner or experienced developer, this guide will help you master Flask web development.''',
